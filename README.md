# Hai! I'm Mini.

Hey there! I'm Mini, a silly little hanging out on the internet. I'm also a transgender furry, and I have a big interest in tech. You will often find me playing VRChat, or hanging out on discord with some friends. Right now, I'm unable to work, so any support would mean the world to me. I always try to be kind to everyone, so feel free to contact me on Discord or email me at mini@mivra.net. I'm always happy to talk!

Some of my projects can be found here or at https://github.com/Project-MIVRA.
